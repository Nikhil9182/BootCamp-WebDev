      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies
      of the red jungle
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">fowl</a> originally
      from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird,
      and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
      is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature
      female is called a pullet.

    <p>
      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,
      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
      Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known
      in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
      every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
      according to the annals of Thutmose III.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
      An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and
      an adult female is called a 'hen'.[10][11] Other terms are: 'Biddy:' a
      newly hatched chicken[12][13] 'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male
      chicken[a] 'Chick:' a young chicken[14] 'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken
      (Australia, informal)[15] 'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a
      year old[16] 'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In
      the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22
      weeks of age.[18] 'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States,
      dialectal)[19] "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at
      least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant
      menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in
      general, especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a
      species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic
      fowl'.[20] 'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and
      Chicken Islands).

    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[22][23][24] and is
      widely used throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching
      aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.
